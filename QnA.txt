What did you like about this project?

I love how this project taught me to create a working game. 
It made me understand how classes and methods work with each other.
The project also gave me a rough idea on how developers systematically approach a task of creating an application. 

What did you struggle with in this project?

I did not know how to start this project. I personally feel that this project had a great spike in difficulty.
Although the materials were covered during class and in Codecademy, 
making sense and putting everything together was extremely difficult.

What would make your experience with this assessment better?
Mini projects(creating methods, classes, algorithms relating to the final assessment)  
leading up to this assessment would be useful. It would give me incremental practice and a chance to put
what I have learnt together.
